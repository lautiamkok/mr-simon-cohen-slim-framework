                <p>Mattie J T Stepanek, the late great peace-maker, poet and prankster, said that a just peace can only take place if all our basic human needs are met. Every year, the We Are Family Foundation brings together 30 Global Teen Leaders to New York for the Just Peace Summit. I've been privileged to be a facilitator at the Just Peace Summit since 2010. In the 2017, I was the Chief Storyteller, tasked with coaching the Global Teen Leaders find and articulate their authentic voices.</p>
